# global-data-exploration

## Dataset Overview
This data was downloaded from gapminder.com. It consists of global data on CO2 emissions, Human Developement Index (HDI), life expecancy, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary school. The data was mosly complete, but as practice I forward filled the data in each dataframe to create a more complete dataset.   

## Summary of Findings
The data on life expectancy and CO2 emissions both went back to 1800 so I chose to investigate the possible ralationship between the two. I began by comparing life expectancy in 1800 and 2018 by plotting both years on a bar chart. The resulting graph shows a huge increase in life expectancy for every recorded country.
